About the event
</h2>


participants will select the domain in which they are comfortable to work.

go to [forkNcommit](https://github.com/forkNcommit2021) organization page and select the repository which suits your domain.

there are 3 domains [Android](https://github.com/forkNcommit2021/Android), [Web](https://github.com/forkNcommit2021/WebDev), [Machine Learning](https://github.com/forkNcommit2021/MachineLearning)

after selecting your prefered domain start working on the problem statement or start building the model which is given to you in the form of `ReadMe.md` file.

for a week you'll work on the project and in between there will be two review meetings(`alpha` and `beta`) for reviewing your work.

A leaderboard will be maintained throughout the event which'll be live, it'll freeze after the second meet `beta review`
