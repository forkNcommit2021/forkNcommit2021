## FAQ :
- **What is Mid Week Review? And how are we going to judge it?**  <br>	
*-->  Mid Week Review is an assessment on the 26th oct (which is the mid day of the week) to check your approach to solve the given problem statements, also judges will take a close look at the continuity of the work, plagiarism checks and also it helps our participants be motivated for a week long event, if you have done a good start and a bit of work you will be eligible for the goodies- but the results are in the hands of judges- no questions asked.*

- **When will the registrations close?**<br>
*-->  The registration closes a day before the Mid Week Review that is on 25th oct 11:59 pm, you can register for the event till the mid-week but not after the review.*
	
- **How to submit the final forked repos?**<br>
*-->  On the mid-week review day we will provide you with a google form link where you have to post your github forked repo link so that we can judge your repository and then give you score accordingly, also note that this repository will only be used as your final submissions as you will make progress on it.*
	
- **What if the code I have written is my own but found similar to that of others? Will it be considered plagiarism?**<br>
*-->  During Mid Week Review, we are going to check the projects for plagiarism by checking the number of commits and the codes. The code will be rechecked during the final judging too. We will also check for any Copyrights. So if the code found is the same with less commits then you will be disqualified.*
	
- **Are there any program language barriers to solve the code? What if one uses a programming language apart from the mentioned languages?**<br>
*-->  Yes, in your problem statements you will be given the set of tools required to solve the problems statement, but if we missed something you can always contact us on discord and we will clarify your doubts regarding that.*
	
- **Speaking about the mid week review of if one fails to qualify in the mid week review will he/she be disqualified?**<br>
*-->Absolutely not- Mid Week Review is not meant for disqualification, it is our program to check the approach of the participants for solving the problem statements and to keep them motivated by providing them goodies, although marks allocated to Mid Week Review can be deducted if someone doesn't pass the judging criteria for the same.*
	
- **How will we have a check on plagiarism and cheating?**<br>
*-->  We have scheduled a Mid Week Review for it. Copyrights will be checked via Github. Anyone found cheating will be disqualified from the event immediately, we also have with us our proctored software team which will be closely monitoring the plagiarism checks.*
	
- **After the registration, how will I get to attend the event?**<br>
*-->  After you register you will receive a confirmation mail which will contain all the details to move ahead and to start working on your specific domains project.*
	
- **Can one person do more than one project in other domains?**<br>
*-->  Yes you can register for projects in different domain with the same github ids but they will both be considered as a separate entries- BUT- you can not participate in the same domain twice (that will be marked as disqualified).*
	
- **If someone completes his project before Mid Week Review will his work be directly accepted?**<br>
*-->  Yes, as long as the code is working and performs all the tasks given in the problem statements along with the documentation of the project, it will be accepted.*
